        <!-- About Indian heritage -->
    </center>
    <span>Indian culture is the heritage of social norms and technologies that originated in or are associated with the
        ethno-linguistically diverse India. The term also applies beyond India to countries and cultures whose histories
        are strongly connected to India by immigration, colonisation, or influence, particularly in South Asia and
        Southeast Asia. India's languages, religions, dance, music, architecture, food and customs differ from place to
        place within the country</span><br>
    <br>
    <span>Indian culture, often labelled as a combination of several cultures, has been influenced by a history that is
        several millennia old, beginning with the Indus Valley civilization and other early cultural areas.[1][2] Many
        elements of Indian culture, such as Indian religions, mathematics, philosophy, cuisine, languages, dance, music
        and movies have had a profound impact across the Indosphere, Greater India, and the world.</span><br>

    <h1 id="cuisine">CUISINE </h1><a href="#top"><i class="fa fa-angle-double-left back">Go Back to top</i></a><br><br>
    <span>A cuisine is a style of cooking characterized by distinctive ingredients, techniques and dishes, and usually
        associated with a specific culture or geographic region. Regional food preparation techniques, customs, and
        ingredients combine to enable dishes unique to a region.
        <br><br> Indian cuisine consists of a variety of regional and traditional cuisines native to India. Given the
        diversity in soil, climate, culture, ethnic groups, and occupations, these cuisines vary substantially and use
        locally available spices, herbs, vegetables, and fruits.

        Indian food is also heavily influenced by religion, in particular Hinduism and Islam, cultural choices and
        traditions

    <span>Clothing in India varies with the different ethnicities, geography, climate, and cultural traditions of the
        people of each region of India. Historically, clothing has evolved from simple garments like kaupina, langota,
        achkan, lungi, sari, well as rituals and dance performances. In urban areas, western clothing is common and
        uniformly worn by people of all social. <br>
        <br> Sometimes, color codes are followed in clothing based on the religion and rituals concerned. The
        traditional style of clothing in India varies with male or female distinctions. This is still followed in rural
        areas, though is changing in the urban areas.</span>
